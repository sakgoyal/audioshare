# Audio server with multi device switching
This project is an audio server that allows you to switch between multiple audio devices seamlessly. It is built using Deno and leverages the power of WebSockets to sync audio playback across different devices.

This is meant to showcase how to rerceate the spotify connect feature using web technologies.

This is a work in progress and is not yet fully functional.
